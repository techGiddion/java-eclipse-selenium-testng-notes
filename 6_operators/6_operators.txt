>> 	What is operator & oprands ?
	Operator: symbols used to perform operation on values [operands]
	Operand: A value involved in the operation


>>	In Java there are 8 types of operators

	1.Unary 
	2.Airthmatic 
	3.Logical
	4.Bitwise
	5.Relational
	6.Assignment
	7.Ternary
	8.Shift 



>>	Unary: require only one operand and can perform :  ++ , -- , !
      1. increment/decrement [pre & post]
	System.out.println(i++ + " Post increment value");  post increment
	System.out.println(i);  11 
	System.out.println(++i + " Post increment value");  post increment 12
	System.out.println(i); 12
	2. inverting the value of boolean
	 !true =	 false
	3. negating an expression - tidal operators [all 1's to 0 and all 0 to 1's]
	 int i = 10;
	 int j = -10;
	 System.out.println(~i);  -11
	 System.out.println(~j);  9


>> 	Airthmatic : +,-,*,/,% 

>>   Logical : && [if one condition is fail it will not check second] and || [if one condition is Pass it will not check second]  

>> 	Bitwise : & and |  [checks both the condition] 

>> 	Relational or conditional operators [> , < ,>=,<=,!= , ==]

>> 	Assignment operator a = 10; , a+=10 , b*=20  a = a + 10 , b = b * 20; 

>>    ternary operator : three operands (condition)?true-a:false - b

>> 	shift operators  
	left hift : << is used to sshift all of the bits in value to the left side of a specified number of times
	10<<2   10*2^2 = 10*4 = 40
     
	right shift >> is used to move the value of the left operand to right by the number of bits specified by the right operand
      10>>2  10/2^2 = 10/4 = 2
      20>>3  20/2^3 = 20/8 = 2
