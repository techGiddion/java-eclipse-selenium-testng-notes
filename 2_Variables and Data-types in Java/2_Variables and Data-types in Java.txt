>> In Java a variable 
	Is a container to store a value basically variable is the calling name of a memory location. 
	Need to add a data-type before variable & based on the that only variable can store the value.

>> There are three types of variable
	local : Declare inside a method , scope inside a method , can not be static.
	instance : Declare inside the class outside the method, need to create the object of same class to access the value , can not be static.
	static : Declare inside the class outside the method, can use directly in any method.

>> Data type 
	Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
	Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)
 

>> byte 
	size: 8-bit 
	Minimum value is -128 (-2^7)
	Maximum value is 127 (inclusive)(2^7 -1)
	byte is four time smaller than an integer.
	Default value is 0

>> short
	size: 16-bit 
	Minimum value is -32,768 (-2^15)
	Maximum value is 32,767 (inclusive) (2^15 -1)
	A short is 2 times smaller than an integer
	Default value is 0.

>> int 
	size: 32-bit 
	Minimum value is - 2,147,483,648 (-2^31)
	Maximum value is 2,147,483,647(inclusive) (2^31 -1)
	The default value is 0

>> long 
	Long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer
	Minimum value is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63)
	Maximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive)(2^63 -1)
	default value is 0L

>> Float 
	Size = 32bit
	Default value is 0.0f
	Float data type is never used for precise values such as currency

>> double
	double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
	Default value is 0.0d

>> boolean
	boolean data type represents one bit of information
	There are only two possible values: true and false
	Default value is false

>> char 
	Size = 16bit
	Minimum value is '\u0000' (or 0)
	Maximum value is '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive)
	Char data type is used to store any character
