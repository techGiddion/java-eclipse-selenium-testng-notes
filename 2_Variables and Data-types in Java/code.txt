//	>> In Java a variable 
//	Is a container to store a value basically variable is the calling name of a memory location. 
//	Need to add a data-type before variable & based on the that only variable can store the value.
//
//>> There are three types of variable
//	local : Declare inside a method , scope inside a method , can not be static.
//	instance : Declare inside the class outside the method, need to create the object of same class to access the value , can not be static.
//	static : Declare inside the class outside the method, can use directly in any method.

//	>> Data type 
//	Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
//	Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes
