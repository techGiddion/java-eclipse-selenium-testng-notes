>>	String in JAVA
 	String is an object which represents a sequence of characters. 
	java.lang.String class is used to create a string object 	
	The String is immutable in Java. [can not extend it]






>>	There are two ways to define string in JAVA
	1. Using String literal
	2. Using new keyword.






>>	String literal
	This way string is created by using double quotes.
	How it works? : each time we create a string literal JVM checks the "string constant pool" to check if string is in it or not.
	if yes : a reference to the pooled instance is returned
	if no: a new string instance is created & placed inside the pool 
	* Use case: To make Java more memory efficient (because no new objects are created if it exists already in the string constant pool).	


example: String text1 = "TechGiddion";
	

>>	By new keyword
	String text2=new String("TechGiddion"); 
	In such case, JVM will create a new string object in normal (non-pool) heap memory, and the literal "TechGiddion" will be placed in the string constant pool. 
	The variable text2 will refer to the object in a heap (non-pool).


>>	Note: String objects are stored in a special memory area known as the "string constant pool".


>>	Methods for String
	.length()
	.charAt(index value)
	.trim()
	.isEmpty()
	.toLowerCase()
	.toUpperCase()
	.replace(The char which needs to be replaced, the char which is the replacement)
	split(value for split);

>>	Converting a char [] to String


>> 	Next line and Tab
	to shift the program to next line we need to use \n , to add the extra space add \t
